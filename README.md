# **WELCOME TO THE SHOPPING LIST FLAVOUR**

Made by KS. for Inspyre

## WHAT DOES THE SHOPPING LIST DO?

1. Fetches data from the server, lists all the products created by any user
2. Deletes data on the server, the user can remove items from the list
3. The user is able to create new items in the list via a stepper form
4. Users are able to modify the details of any item.
5. If no connection or some error has occured during the server requests, the user will be notified by a notification window
6. Smooth transitions, loading animations and design was made for an enhanced User Experience
7. Mobile and tablet responsive
8. Added and customized a date picker which goes well with the design.
9. Form validation, character limitation (due to server errors)
10. Due date notification on each item on the list page
